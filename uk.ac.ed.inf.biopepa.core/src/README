To compile and run Bio-PEPA from source the following is required:

1. Eclipse for RCP and RAP developers, available at www.eclipse.org
2. BIRT Framework, downloadable from within Eclipse.
3. All 4 Bio-PEPA packages (technically feature is not required to compile and
   run)
3. All 5 common packages (technically feature is not required to compile and
   run)

Unpack and launch Eclipse. BIRT Framework can be found in the Business
Intelligence, Reporting and Charting category. Add the packages, compile and
then run as Eclipse Application to confirm the installation succeeded.

The Bio-PEPA Parser is automatically generated using Java CUPS and JFlex.
To alter the parser edit the JFlex and CUPs file in grammar/ and run the ant
file in ant/. After doing so, assuming you are developing in Eclipse
(recommended) you will need to refresh uk.ac.ed.inf.biopepa.core.dom.internal
at which point Eclipse will 'see' the new parser and compile.
