      <p>
         <ol>
           <li> Reading in csv files does not allow comment lines begun with #
                but it should. This is due to the library used, either a better one
                should be found or alternatively it wouldn't be that hard to code
                one up ourselves.
           </li>
           <li> The Simulation Tracer algorithm does not understand compartments </li>
           <li> The Prism output does not understand compartments </li>
         </ol>

      <h3>
        Desired Features
      </h3>
      <p>
      	<ol>
      	  <li> A default system equation consisting of all the defined reagents
      	       all cooperating with <*> 
      	  </li>
      	  <li> Allow defined names to not be used in the system equation and
      	  thereby "knocking out their behaviour". Maria Luisa has the details on
      	  this enhancement.
      	  </li>
      	  <li> Output the time it took to perform a simulation </li>
      	  <li> The Invariants view could be nicer in particular we could
      	  output a copy+pastable format.
      	  </li>
